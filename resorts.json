		"Description": "The Adaaran Select Hudhuranfushi resort is among the best choices in the Maldives. It’s located on one of the sunny Maldives islands named Lohifushi. This report provides you with a private place that grants relaxation and tranquility. Adaaran Select Hudhuranfushi is the first 5-star boutique resort in the Maldives. A quick transfer via speedboat to 19 km away from Male for just a 30-minute ride will bring you to the white beaches of a brand-new island created by an undersea volcano. Experience a different kind of indulgence with a relaxing menu of massage therapies, spa baths, and facials at Chavana Spa, you’ll feel like you’re at your own private day spa in your hotel room. The list of treatments: Elemis Pro-Collagen Quartz Lift Facial, Elemis Skin IQ+ Facial for Men, Elemis Skin Specific Facial, Elemis Exotic Frangipani Body Nourish Wrap, Elemis Exotic Lime &amp; Ginger Salt Glow, Journey of the Senses, Frangipani Body Glow, Heaven &amp; Earth, Chavana Massage, Warm Stone Massage, Traditional Balinese Massage, Asian Foot Massage, Purity Facial, Spa Pedicure, Spa Manicure. It is highly recommended that you bring closed shoes when walking around (in and out) the resort since it doesn’t have ground grass or beach sand. Furthermore, even though the resort doesn’t really have a lot to offer that would intensify one’s experience and make one fall in love with it immediately upon arrival, I can assure you that Adaaran Select has its way of charming its guests—and boy does it! Three restaurants &amp; four bars serve up sumptuous international cuisine. Banyan Restaurant has an elegant breakfast buffet, with daily fresh seafood platters, while Sunset Restaurant offers candlelight seafood dinners and wine. At Lohis Bar, cocktails can be enjoyed in a chic setting – admire the sunset over the Indian Ocean The resort guarantee that your child will spend the time fun and educationally. Our teacher will be in charge of the children to develop their new skills and turn them into great personalities.",

		"Google Map Link": "https://goo.gl/maps/88euV1QKUmsQF6JB6",
		"Description": "Villa Nautica is a 20-minute speedboat ride from Malé International Airport. In general, the island is quite large according to Maldives standards so it may be described as quite a big and busy resort. Yet you may still find some privacy, especially on the east side of the island which is far from the main facilities area. The service of the resort is highly estimated and rated as exceptional. The resort is well-maintained and always clean and the staff is extremely helpful. The check-in process is fast and all transfers to the airport are well-planned and managed. Everything is set up so that you could enjoy your holiday to the fullest being inspired by those amazing views from the overwater villas or enjoying the beach from a stunning beach bungalow. Moreover, the highlight of your visit may also become the spa, which actually represents a far higher class of the hotel from the design to service and amenities. The reef of the island is very inspirational. There’s nothing so picturesque alike. The house reef abounds with colorful fish and corals of all sizes and varieties. Six restaurants and five bars introduce an exceptional variety of options to dine and wine. The restaurants are located in unforgettable settings and offer delicious cuisine combining flavors from Japan or Italy.",

		"Description": "Villas at Cinnamon Hakuraa Huraa provide visitors with an opulent experience next to white sand beaches and crystal-clear lagoon waters. It has a top-notch spa and a bar atop stilts. After an exciting day of snorkeling, eating under the stars, or simply taking in the tranquility of the ocean waves while you soak up the sun, rely on the magnificent bungalows to comfortably relax you. Maximize your use of it. After all, this is your private island. Full body massages and relaxing foot massages are just two of the spa services you may enjoy together. You may go out to sea and do some relaxing things like fishing, seeing dolphins, or kayaking. Water sports (both motorized and non-motorized), diving and snorkeling among sea turtles and other marine life at a coral reef, beach volleyball, and a fitness center are just some of the land-based activities available to our more daring guests. Platinum Island is an adults-only hideaway in Cinnamon Hakuraa Huraa Maldives, set apart from the rest of the resort with its own private pool, restaurant (Manzaru), bar (Vevu), and luxurious beach bungalows (Platinum Beach Bungalows). This is the most discreet option available. Cinnamon Hakuraa Huraa is located 145 km from the capital, Male. It is a 45-minute seaplane transfer from Velana International Airport.",

		"Description": "Since Hurawalhi Island Resort opened in December 2016, the luxurious and adults-only (there’s under 15 age limit) Hurawalhi Maldives Resort is perfect for your honeymoon, wedding, or beach holiday on a beautiful private coral island. Snorkeling off the beach is easy as the reef is a stone thrown away. The lagoon is quite shallow so that you can walk up to the reef in some places. The house reef itself is quite safe as you may not encounter any currents. The reef of Huralwalhi abounds with life and it is a pleasure to snorkel around the entire island. All in all, there are 90 rooms of five different types of villas. Wi-Fi is free in all rooms. It should be mentioned that east-oriented villas(see sunrise villas) are said to be more private because of the dense vegetation dividing the villas and the sea. There is an outdoor pool, a spa, a restaurant, and a bar. All rooms at the resort include an air-conditioner and a flat-screen TV. The staff is accommodating and customer service oriented. The underwater restaurant 5.8m is surely an experience of a lifetime. You may see some amazing marine life and dine in a breathtaking setting. The spa at Hurawalhi offers a wide range of treatments. The therapists are lovely and super friendly recharging you with positive energy. The treatments offer you a relaxing and enjoyable pastime with a view over the Indian Ocean, The transfer from Velana International Airport will not make you feel tired, it’s only a 40-minute breathtaking flight along the scenic view from your seaplane. Min. stay is 3 nights.",
